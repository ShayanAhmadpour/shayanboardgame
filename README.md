this project contains a board game named derby(in our country means the competition between the red and the blue team in soccer) which
the board is somehow like the chess board with different demensions(5*7) and two added goals for each team.
we have 11 pieces for each team.
one 1 in the goal
two 2s
two 3s
two 4s
two 5s
two 6s
and each team has two rows at the start(without counting the goal)
and each row must have maximum of one type of pieces from 2 to 6.
the game moves depends on a dice.
we can choose one of two numbered pieces which is same as the number of dice and move it to front,front-left and front-right.
the goal of the game is opening opponent gate and direct at least 1 piece to the opponents gate.
